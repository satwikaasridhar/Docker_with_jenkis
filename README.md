# 🚀 Simple Jenkins CI/CD Pipeline

This project demonstrates a **basic CI/CD pipeline** using Jenkins and Docker. The pipeline automates building, testing, and deploying a simple application whenever new code is pushed to the repository.

## 📦 Tools & Technologies

- **Jenkins** (Installed locally or on a cloud instance)
- **Docker**
- **GitHub** (for source code management)
- **Sample App** (any basic app – e.g., a Node.js, Python, or static site)

## 📁 Project Structure

├── app/ # Your application code ├── Dockerfile # Dockerfile for building app image ├── Jenkinsfile # Jenkins pipeline definition └── README.md # Project documentation


## 🛠️ Jenkinsfile Overview

The pipeline includes the following stages:

1. **Checkout** – Pulls the latest code from the repository.
2. **Build** – Builds the Docker image for the application.
3. **Test** – (Optional) Runs any basic tests (can be extended).
4. **Deploy** – Runs the Docker container or pushes to a registry.
Install Jenkins:

Official Jenkins Installation Guide

Install Docker Plugin in Jenkins.

Create a Pipeline Job:

Link it to this GitHub repository.

Configure the trigger for GitHub hook trigger for GITScm polling.

🔁 How it Works
Commit and push changes to your GitHub repo.

Jenkins detects the change and triggers the pipeline.

The app is built, optionally tested, and deployed via Docker.

✅ Test the Pipeline
Push a change to your repo.

Watch the Jenkins dashboard for build status.

Verify the app is running on the configured port (e.g., http://localhost:8080).

📌 Notes
Make sure Docker is installed and running on the Jenkins host.

You can extend the pipeline with additional stages like linting, security checks, or deployment to cloud providers.
